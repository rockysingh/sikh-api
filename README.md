## Introduction

Welcome to the Sikh API. This API is built using Spring-Boot Framework and Java. We are also using MongoDB.

This API is/will be built to retrieve the following data:

* Guru's
* Panj Pyare
* Char Sahibzade

If you would like anything else adding please suggest it or just raise a PR.

## Demo
